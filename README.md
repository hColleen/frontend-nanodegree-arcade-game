frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game
===============================
Live version [here](https://hcolleen.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game/)
===============================


To play:
Use arrow keys to move the astrophysicist around the board to collect stars.  Collect 10 and you're on your way to a professorship!  Get caught and listen to a lecture on your field of study by someone who only knows what TIME magazine has tweeted about it, but feels obligated to tell you everything about it.  You'll also lose all your stars if you get caught.


Dependencies: Bootstrap 4.1.0, JQuery 3.3.1, browser must support forEach as a function, and canvas


To play from download
===============================

To play in a local browser:
Download the files from the [repository](https://github.com/hColleen/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game) using the 'Clone/Download' button.

Keep the files in one folder and open the index file in a browser.  IE/Edge is not reccomended.  Being fully offline is not reccomended, either, as Bootstrap and JQuery are delivered from a content distribution network server rather than being in the files.  Being fully offline will prevent the modal pop-ups from working correctly and may affect the score display.

Game play is the same whether playing the live version or the local version.
