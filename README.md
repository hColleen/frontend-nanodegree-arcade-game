To play:
Use arrow keys to move the astrophysicist around the board to collect stars.  Collect 10 and you're on your way to a professorship!  Get caught and listen to a lecture on your field of study by someone who only knows what TIME magazine has tweeted about it, but feels obligated to tell you everything about it.  You'll also lose all your stars if you get caught.


Dependencies: Bootstrap 4.1.0, JQuery 3.3.1, browser must support forEach as a function, and canvas
